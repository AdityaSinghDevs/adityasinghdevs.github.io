<!-- Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

## Hi, I’m Aditya.

I am an AI engineer and research-oriented undergraduate focused on **computer vision, diffusion models, and large language model systems**, with an emphasis on **reproducible experimentation, production-grade AI pipelines**.

My work spans applied computer vision, LLM-based systems, and open-source contributions, including work on **Intel OpenVINO**. I am particularly interested in the intersection of **model architecture, training workflows, and system-level design**, and how these choices affect real-world deployment and research validity.

This website serves as a record of my **projects, research directions, technical writing, and academic progress**.


<!-- <p>
Currently I am a Junior undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering, Specializing in AI & Data Science at GGSIPU (VIPS-TC), A student nerding out on everything architectures, training workflows, and papers people have written in this field, especially the kind that make you pause and wonder <b>, "How did they even build this?"</b>.<br>
I love how apart from skills, unlike other fields in CS, this field demands and rewards academic brilliance, especially in subjects students shy away from like mathematics, epistemology, neuroscience etc., that often become fundamental ideas behind many papers.
</p>

<p>
Most of my time goes into reading, breaking down complex ideas, discussing them with peers, and learning how to bring them to code.<br> I am currently figuring out how to structure clean industry standard AI projects, implement papers, understand good engineering practices, and slowly move towards production-grade systems. I plan to start writing blogs about these learnings, create projects, simplifying tough papers, sharing code insights and maybe even write a research paper on my own this year.
</p>
<p>
This website is my way of documenting all of that. A resume can't capture the full story. I wanted a space that reflects the actual journey, with it's pivots, wrong turns, and quiet breakthroughs.<br>A place where others can learn, even if it's just one small thing. And someday when I've carved a reputation in this field, I want this site to be the anchor, a window back to where it all started. </p> -->

## About Me

I am an undergraduate engineerinng student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a strong interest in **research-oriented machine learning systems and applied LLM engineering**.

My interests lie in understanding how **modern language models behave under practical constraints**, particularly in settings involving **parameter-efficient adaptation, model compression, and retrieval-augmented reasoning**. I am especially drawn to research that emphasizes **clear problem formulation, controlled experimentation, and reproducibility**, rather than isolated benchmark gains.

In parallel, I have built **production-grade AI systems**, including scalable inference services, modular ML pipelines, and deployment-ready backends, following close to production level practices.These systems-level experiences strongly inform how I approach research questions in practice.

I have contributed to open-source optimization efforts within **Intel’s OpenVINO ecosystem**, and I currently lead **Advait**, a 300+ member AI community, where I coordinate teams, research- and project-focused initiatives and events.

My long-term goal is to work as a **research engineer**, bridging the gap between modern machine learning research and reliable, high-impact real-world systems.
