<!-- Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

Artificial intelligence is more than just a buzzword or a tool — it's a shift in how we build, reason, and even imagine. I’ve found myself drawn to this space not just because it’s powerful, but because it’s messy, evolving, and deeply human at its core.

I’m currently an undergraduate studying AI & Data Science at GGSIPU (VIPS-TC), where I spend most of my time learning how models learn — and occasionally making them learn better. Whether it’s breaking down transformer internals, cleaning up notebooks, or tuning models with LoRA, I enjoy understanding what goes on under the hood.

This site is where I’ll share my experiments, side projects, ideas-in-progress, and maybe a paper or two as I grow. I don’t claim to know everything — but I like asking the right questions and getting a little closer to the answer each time.

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now at the California Institute of Technology.
