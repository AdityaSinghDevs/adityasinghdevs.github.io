# Aditya Pratap Singh

> I build machines that learn, explain what I learn to machines (and humans), and sometimes convince both that I know what I’m doing.

I'm a second-year B.Tech student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at GGSIPU (VIPS-TC), and I spend most of my time messing around with machine learning models, embedded sensors, radar signatures, and large language models.

My projects range from drone-vs-bird classifiers using micro-Doppler radar signatures, to low-cost conservation kits with ESP32s, to building LLM-based Reddit persona generators (yes, really). When I’m not coding, I lead Advait (our AI society), contribute to open source (OpenVINO), and occasionally breathe.

### Interests
- Efficient AI: QLoRA, LLM fine-tuning, edge-device optimization
- Vision & Sensing: Micro-Doppler, CV on ESP32, depth + segmentation
- Open Source: Dev infra, ML logging, inference pipelines
- Federated Learning (the next thing I want to write a paper on)

### Leadership
Currently Deputy Vice President of Advait (AI Society, VIPS-TC) where I host events, hackathons, and contribute to building an AI culture that goes beyond buzzwords.

Let’s build something meaningful — or at least get the accuracy above 94%.
