<!-- Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

<p>Hey I am Aditya,<br>
What started as a buzzword driven leap into the AI space, in hopes of future-proofing my career has turnt into a pursuit of understanding and building real world AI systems.
The more I explored the more I realised Artificial Intelligence is just not another bandwagon, it's a paradigm shift, that will shift the world to new levels, The AI wave has arrived, The Tsunami is close behind, And I want to be prepared to ride it when it comes.<br>
More than that, I want to leave a mark in this space, Create something that leaves a legacy, Maybe a system, Maybe a machine, I don't know yet. But, I’m certain that one day, I want to look back and know I contributed something meaningful to this space.
</p>

<p>This site documents that journey, where it began, where it’s going, and everything in between.</p>

<!-- <p>
Currently I am a Junior undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering, Specializing in AI & Data Science at GGSIPU (VIPS-TC), A student nerding out on everything architectures, training workflows, and papers people have written in this field, especially the kind that make you pause and wonder <b>, "How did they even build this?"</b>.<br>
I love how apart from skills, unlike other fields in CS, this field demands and rewards academic brilliance, especially in subjects students shy away from like mathematics, epistemology, neuroscience etc., that often become fundamental ideas behind many papers.
</p>

<p>
Most of my time goes into reading, breaking down complex ideas, discussing them with peers, and learning how to bring them to code.<br> I am currently figuring out how to structure clean industry standard AI projects, implement papers, understand good engineering practices, and slowly move towards production-grade systems. I plan to start writing blogs about these learnings, create projects, simplifying tough papers, sharing code insights and maybe even write a research paper on my own this year.
</p>
<p>
This website is my way of documenting all of that. A resume can't capture the full story. I wanted a space that reflects the actual journey, with it's pivots, wrong turns, and quiet breakthroughs.<br>A place where others can learn, even if it's just one small thing. And someday when I've carved a reputation in this field, I want this site to be the anchor, a window back to where it all started. </p> -->

<p>Lately, I've been learning how to work with large language models, how do they work, how concepts like LoRa and Quantised-LoRa work at their mathematical cores, how to fine-tune these LLM's the right way, understand the guts of how they are formed, and how to apply them the right way. Alongside that, I’ve been going deeper into core concepts and reading about all the wild new ideas coming out in the space.
<br>Well at times it feels like a lot. But thats the point.<br></p>
